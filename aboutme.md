I am an independent game developer with a passion for RPGs, Rougelikes and platformers.  I am constantly trying to learn more about game development and the industry so throw me a message if you want to chat.

In class I am working in C++ to develop game essential tools for a basic 2D engine, and out of class I am working on a short platformer to show what I can do.
